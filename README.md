# GoldBadgeConsoleApplicationChallenges
Welcome to the ReadMefile for my Gold Badge Console Aplication Chalenges.
This project is an assignment for the ElevenFifty Software Development Gold Badge level.
It consists of three challenges.
1. Komodo Cafe
2. Komodo Insurance Claims
3. Komodo Security Badges

The first challenge (Komodo Cafe) required me to create a console app that manages the list of a cafe menu.
When creating the 'price' of a meal object I had to search for the proper format to display a decimal data type - used for price - 
to disply with a dollar sign and two decimals.  I found the ToString("C2") format to properly display the price of a meal.

The second challenge (Komodo Insurance Claims) required use and management of Queues.  

The third challenge (Komodo Badges) required use and management of a Dictionary.
