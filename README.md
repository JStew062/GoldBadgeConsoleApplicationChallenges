# GoldBadgeConsoleApplicationChallenges
Welcome to the ReadMefile for my Gold Badge Console Aplication Chalenges.
The first challenge (Komodo Cafe) required me to create a console app that manages the list of a cafe menu.
When creating the 'price' of a meal object I had to search for the proper format to display a decimal data type - used for price - 
to disply with a dollar sign and two decimals.  I found the ToString("C2") format to properly display the price of a meal.
